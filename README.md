The Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C is a classic implementation of the popular game. The player begins by choosing their symbol, either X or O, and the computer automatically takes the opposite symbol. The game alternates between the player's move and the computer's move until one of the following occurs:

A player wins: Either the player or the computer successfully aligns three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
The game ends in a draw: All spaces on the board are filled, but no player has achieved three in a row.
The board is displayed after every turn, showing the current state of the game. The player inputs their desired row and column for their move, while the computer selects its moves randomly from the available spaces. Once the game concludes, the result is displayed (win, loss, or draw), and the player is prompted to play again or exit.
